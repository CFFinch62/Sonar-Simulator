# Sonar-Simulator
BASIC256 Sonar Simlulator

I wrote this basic sonar simulator just to see how easy it would be to do.
I work in the techincal support field for a marine electronics manufacturer.
I often have to explain sonr, radar, echosounder, and autopilot to end users.
I thought if I could easily make some simple simulations it would help.

There are better tools to do this with but I don't want it ot be a life's work.
Use this project as you see fit to learn what you can.

I have included some work I did to start on forward looking scaning sonar but did nto get very far.
